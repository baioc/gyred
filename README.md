This is a reference implementation of [Gyre](https://baioc.github.io/gyred/package.html), a compiler IR designed as a practical "linguistic switchbox", or [UNCOL](https://www.osdata.com/topic/language/uncol.htm).
<br/>
As such, the IR should be able to efficiently accommodate many high-level languages and target architectures.
<br/>
Thus, this repository contains multiple compiler implementations, all using the same middle-end infrastructure.
